  <h2>01 Prepare : Background Knowledge</h2>

  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>Welcome to Week One of CS 313!</p>

  <p>This week you will be learning about the course, getting to know each other, creating cloud platform accounts, setting up our development environments, and following the time honored "Hello World!" tradition by creating an HTML file and deploying it to an application in the cloud.</p>

  <h3>Git and GitHub</h3>
  <p>For this class, we will dive right in to Git and assume that you either have a working knowledge of it, or can come up to speed quickly. If you are a little uneasy about Git, here are some resources that may be helpful for you:</p>

  <ul>
  	<li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r63f51ce84A" target="_blank">Git Video Tutorial</a> - This is a great video tutorial that introduces Git.</p></li>
  	<li><p><a href="https://byui-cs.github.io/CS246/week-04/prepare.html" target="_blank">Version Control with GitHub</a> - This is the introduction to Git from CS 246. It also contains links of the place to go to sign up for a free student account.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Client Side Web Development</h3>
  <p>This semester we will focus our work on server-side development, and will assume you have a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript. If this is not the case, you should review these concepts before proceeding. There are lots of Websites out there with HTML tutorials including:</p>
  <ul><li><p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/" target="_blank">W3schools HTML 5 Tutorial</a></p></li></ul>

  <h3>Classroom Examples (Optional)</h3>
    <p>Sometimes in the classroom we work through a particular example together, and it has been helpful for the online students to see that example, and for the campus students to go back and review it later. To help with this, we have recorded a few of these and made them available here. They aren't necessarily scripted or polished, but rather, are an attempt to give you the kind of discussion that would be in the classroom. They are optional, supplementary material that you are welcome to use inasmuch as they are helpful to you.</p>
