  <h2>01 Prove : Hello World Assignment : Install Local Server</h2>

  <h3>Set Up Local Environment</h3>

  <p>You could do all of your development and testing right on your server, but this can be a little cumbersome, and you
    may want to debug your application a little more thoroughly before you make it available to the world. Thus, it is
    nice to have a development environment on your local machine, and then you can push your changes to the server when
    they are ready to deploy.</p>

  <p>Because we will be writing server-side code this semester, you cannot simply double-click an HTML file and view it in a browser like you could in a client-side class. Instead, you will need a server to execute the code and prepare the HTML to be rendered in the browser. For this reason, you will install a server on your personal computer and use it for debugging purposes.</p>

  <p>For the first half of the semester, we will be using PHP 5.x with the Apache HTTP Server and Postgres databases.
    There are some nice (free) packages that will help you install and set up these tools on your laptop. It is
    recommended that you download and install one. (If presented with an option, <strong>select the 5.x versions instead of the
        7.x versions</strong> as they include the desired 5.x version of PHP.)</p>
