  <h2>01 Teach : Ice Breaker</h2>

  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>The term "icebreakers" refers to ships designed to break up ice to facilitate travel through ice-packed regions. A
    flow of ice might well describe the atmosphere of an online class before it gets off the ground. Icebreakers are
    meant to put you at ease, get your mental juices flowing, and allow you to meet your fellow classmates. Have fun and
    be creative with the following exercise.</p>
