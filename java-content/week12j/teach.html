        <h2>12 Teach : Team Activity</h2>

        <div class="online-notes">

            <h4>Special Instructions for Online Students</h4>

            <p>You need to coordinate a one hour synchronous meeting with your group for this activity.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Use JPA to create a simple Java application that lists authors and the books they have written. For simplicity, we will assume that each book was only written by one author (but authors can write multiple books). Also, for simplicity, you may write this as a standalone Java application (not a web app).</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Using JPA, list all the authors in the DB with the books they have written. Then, using JPA, in your Java code, create a new author, and a new book written by that author, add them to the database, and show the list again.</p>

        <div class="tips">
            <p>Instructor's Tip</p>
            <p>Make sure to reference the Students/Majors example in this week's preparation material as it is very similar to your assignment.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Core requirements</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Create a new PostgreSQL database for your authors and books. Add a table for each of these entities and create a user with permissions to this DB.</p>
                <p>Insert a few authors and books into your DB.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Using JPA, retrieve each Author from the DB and display them to the screen.</p></li>
            <li><p>For each author, retrieve their books and display them to the screen as well.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Stretch Challenges</h4>
        <p>After finishing the core requirements, ensure that everyone is at that point and understands the material. When everyone has completed the core requirements, you can move on to these stretch challenges.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Using JPA, add a new Author to your database.</p></li>
            <li><p>Again, using JPA, add two books to an author and persist them to the database.</p></li>
            <li><p>Create a new class for Genre that contain a genre name (e.g., Science Fiction, Fantasy, Historical Fiction, etc). Allow books to have a genre. Use JPA to automatically create the corresponding table in the database.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Instructor's Solution</h3>
        <p>As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one. One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide insights from this comparison.</p>

        <p>Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core requirements, if you code them up yourself.</p>

        <p>After working with your team for the one hour activity, <a href="https://github.com/byui-cs/cs313-course/tree/master/week12/ta-solution/" target="_blank">click here for the instructor's solution</a>.</p>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before submitting the assessment.</p>
