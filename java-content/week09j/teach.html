        <div class="online-notes">

            <h4>Special Instructions for Online Students</h4>

            <p>You need to coordinate a one hour synchronous meeting with your group for this activity.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>Be able to use servlets and JSPs together to accomplish a simple task.</p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Create a login page (JSP) that accepts a username and password. If a correct username and password is entered, it should direct the user to a welcome page showing their username. If an incorrect username and password are entered, it should direct them to an incorrect password page.</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>First, create a JSP login page with a username and password box. Submission of the form should post to a login servlet.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Create a login servlet to check for a valid username and password (at this point a correct username and password to check against can be hard coded into the servlet's code). If the username and password match, put the username on the session and send the user to a welcome page, if not send them to an incorrect login page.</p>
                <p>This also requires that you create a JSP incorrect login page.</p>
            </li>
            
            <li><p>Create a JSP welcome page that says &ldquo;Welcome [username]&rdquo; (getting the username from the session). Also have a link to logout, this should post to a logout servlet.</p></li>

            <li><p>Create a logout servlet that removes the username from the session if present, and redirects the user back to the login page.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Stretch Challenges</h4>
        <p>After finishing the core requirements, ensure that everyone is at that point and understands the material. When everyone has completed the core requirements, you can move on to these stretch challenges.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Combine the incorrect login page with the sign in page. So that it is only one page, but the presence of extra data causes it to display an incorrect login message before the username and password boxes. This can be done by having the servlet store information on the request before transferring to the JSP.</p></li>

            <li><p>Deploy your app to one of your servers.</p></li>

            <li><p>Store a list of usernames and passwords in a file on the server and use that to validate in your login servlet.<p></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Instructor's Solution</h3>
        <p>As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one. One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide insights from this comparison.</p>

        <p>Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core requirements, if you code them up yourself.</p>

        <p>After working with your team for the one hour activity, <a href="https://github.com/byui-cs/cs313-course/tree/master/week09/ta-solution/" target="_blank">click here for the instructor's solution</a>.</p>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before submitting the assessment.</p>
