    <h3>Preparation Material</h3>
    <p>Before meeting with your team, please review the following material on database access using Java. Please note
        that in order to interact with a database, you need to have a Postgres instance that you can interact with.
        Thus, while you are developing your code you need to do one of the following:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Deploy your development code to your server where your Postgres instance exists.</p></li>
        <li><p>Install a local instance of Postgres for development</p></li>
        <li><p>Open the Postgres port on your server to allow remote connections, so that you can connect directly to it
            from your local machine.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <p>Option 1 (deploying your code for each test), can be cumbersome, especially if you are not using an automated
        build/deployment process.</p>
    <p>Option 3 can be a major security risk. It is best practice to NOT allow direct connection to your database from
        outside your server(or data center/VPN, if your application is not all running on the same server).</p>
    <p>Thus, the best approach is to install Postgres locally on your development machine, so you can test and debug
        code there, and then when it is ready to deploy, you actually deploy it to your server and do final testing
        there.</p>
    <p>At this point, we can continue to use the Postgres instance that we downloaded with WAPP/MAPP/XAMPP for our Java
        development.</p>
    <p>Please go through the following <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/jdbc/jdbc-introduction.htm" target="_blank">
        tutorial on JDBC from tutorials point.</a> (This tutorial is geared towards MySQL instead of Postgres, but the
        concepts are the same.) Please read the sections noted below in detail, and then at least skim over the others.
    </p>
    <p>Please go through these sections in detail:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Introduction</p></li>
        <li><p>Sample Code</p></li>
        <li><p>Connections</p></li>
        <li><p>Statements</p></li>
        <li><p>Result Sets</p></li>
        <li><p>JDBC Examples: Insert, Select, Update, WHERE clause</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>As always, you are encouraged to play around with the example code and find additional material outside the
        assigned reading. Please post helpful information to the course wiki.</p>
    <p>As noted in the tutorial, you will need to get the JDBC driver for your database (in our case Postgres). This can
        be
        <a href="https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html" target="_blank">downloaded directly from this page.</a> This
        JAR
        should be put into your lib directory.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, if you are using Maven, you can simply add this dependency to your pom.xml file, instead of
        manually downloading the JAR file:

    <pre><code>
&lt;dependency&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;groupId&gt;org.postgresql&lt;/groupId&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;artifactId&gt;postgresql&lt;/artifactId&gt;
&nbsp; &lt;version&gt;9.4.1212&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</code></pre>
