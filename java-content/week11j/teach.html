        <div class="online-notes">

            <h4>Special Instructions for Online Students</h4>

            <p>You need to coordinate a one hour synchronous meeting with your group for this activity.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>For this activity, we will be using JDBC to connect to a PostgreSQL database and display information in a Java web application.</p>

        <p>Consider the case of a list of ancestors in a database. For simplicity, each person should have a first name, last name, and birthday. For a stretch challenge you will create a relationship between parents and children modeled in the database (many to many).</p>

        <p>Then on a web page, you should display a list of all the people in the database. Each name should be a link, where if you click on it, a person details page should be display that shows the person, along with their children (if they exist in the database) and their parents (if they exist in the database).</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <h4>Core requirements</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>First, ensure that you have PostgreSQL installed on your development machine. Then, create a Person table in the database. Finally, insert some test people.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create a Java web application with a page to display each person in the database.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Don't forget to include the dependcies in your pom.xml (or the JAR's) for the JDBC connector, as well as the JSTL.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Write a simple query to select all the people from the database and return them.</p></li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li><p>Make each name on this page a link to a Person Details page. At this point, have the Person Details page simply display the name and birthday of the person.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Stretch Challenges</h4>
        <p>After finishing the core requirements, ensure that everyone is at that point and understands the material. When everyone has completed the core requirements, you can move on to these stretch challenges.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Create a ChildOf table in the database to model the many-to-many relationship.</p></li>
            <li><p>On the Person Details page, display the children and ancestors of the current person.</p></li>
            <li><p>Convert the names of the children and ancestor into links that go to the person details page for those people.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Instructor's Solution</h3>
        <p>As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one. One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide insights from this comparison.</p>

        <p>Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core requirements, if you code them up yourself.</p>

        <p>After working with your team for the one hour activity, <a href="https://github.com/byui-cs/cs313-course/tree/master/week11/ta-solution/" target="_blank">click here for the instructor's solution</a>.</p>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before submitting the assessment.</p>
