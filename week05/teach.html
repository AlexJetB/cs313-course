            <h4>Special Instructions for Online Students</h4>

            <p>You need to coordinate a one hour synchronous meeting with your group for this activity.</p>

            <p>For this assignment, you should work on the same database/PHP file, (rather than doing this separately), so you will want to use screen sharing or other collaborative programs to ensure everyone can be involved.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Your assignment is to create a simple database and query it to display results on a PHP page.</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <h4>Core Requirements</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Create a new database table called "Scriptures" that has the following columns:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>id</p></li>
                    <li><p>book</p></li>
                    <li><p>chapter</p></li>
                    <li><p>verse</p></li>
                    <li><p>content</p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><p>Insert the following scriptures (along with the text of the verse as content) into your database:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>John 1:5</p></li>
                    <li><p>Doctrine and Covenants 88:49</p></li>
                    <li><p>Doctrine and Covenants 93:28</p></li>
                    <li><p>Mosiah 16:9</p></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Step 3:&nbsp;</b>Create a PHP page to query this database and list the scriptures. Put a heading at the top of the page to display "Scripture Resources". Then for each scripture, display the book chapter and verse in bold, followed by a hyphen and then the content of the scripture in quotes. For example:</p>

                <hr />
                <p><span style="font-size:2em; font-weight:bold;">Scripture Resources</span></p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:bold">John 3:16</span> - "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."</p>
                <p><span style="font-weight:bold">Proverbs 3:5</span> - "Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding."</p>
                <hr />
            </li>

        </ol>

        <h4>Stretch Challenges</h4>
        <p>After finishing the core requirements, ensure that everyone is at that point and understands the material. When everyone has completed the core requirements, you can move on to these stretch challenges.</p>

        <ol>

            <li><p>Create a PHP form to search for a book and display all the scriptures in your database that match that book.</p></li>
            <li><p>Change your results page so that it only lists the book, chapter, and verse of the scripture (not the content), but make that text a link. Have the link lead to a "Scripture Details" page where the user can see the content for the selected scripture.</p>
                <p>Hint: You might consider adding the scripture id as a query parameter for the details page link.</p></li>
            <li><p>Build out the Scripture Details page. It should display the reference and the content for the scripture that was clicked.</p></li>
<!--             <li><p>Push this database and code to one of your servers and get it to work there.</p></li>
 -->        </ol>

        <h3>Instructor's Solution</h3>
        <p>As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one. One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide insights from this comparison.</p>

        <p>Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core requirements, if you code them up yourself.</p>

        <p>After working with your team for the one hour activity, <a href="https://github.com/byui-cs/cs313-course/tree/master/week05/ta-solution/" target="_blank">click here for the instructor's solution</a>.</p>

        <div class="tips">
            <p>Instructor Tips</p>
            <p>If you are trying to create your code in such a way that it can work on both a local development server and at Heroku, without needing to make any code changes, here is an <a href="https://github.com/byui-cs/cs313-course/tree/master/week05/ta-solution/heroku_and_local_example" target="_blank">alternative solution</a> that shows a way to that, following the instructions in this week's <a href="prepare-heroku-connect.html" target="_blank">preparation material</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before submitting the assessment.</p>
