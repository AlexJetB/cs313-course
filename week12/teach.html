        <div class="online-notes">

            <h4>Special Instructions for Online Students</h4>

            <p>You need to coordinate a one hour synchronous meeting with your group for this activity.</p>

        </div>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>Practice using middleware and sessions and learn how to restrict access to certain pages to only authorized users.</p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>For this team activity you will create three web service endpoints:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p><code>POST /login</code> - Expects a username and password as post variables.</p></li>
            <li><p><code>POST /logout</code> - If a user is logged in, this will clear the session (logging them out)</p></li>
            <li><p><code>GET /getServerTime</code> - If a user is logged in, this will return the current server time, if they are not logged in, it will return a 401 status code (unauthorized).</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p>To help you get started and to help you test your web services, please use the following files that you can include in your static files directory:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><a href="https://github.com/byui-burton/cs313-course-dev/tree/master/week12/ta-solution/public/test.html">test.html</a> - Includes a simple HTML form with a username, password, and three buttons corresponding to the web services listed above.</p></li>
            <li><p><a href="https://github.com/byui-burton/cs313-course-dev/tree/master/week12/ta-solution/public/test.js">test.js</a> - Contains the event handler methods that will call your Web services, it will update a "status" div on the html page with the results.</p></li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <h4>Core Requirements</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Create a new node.js application. Setup express and include the test.html and test.js files from above. Make sure you can view these pages in a browser.</p>

                <p>Create a Post route for <code>/login</code>. This should receive a username and password as post parameters (in the body of the request). First make sure you can get these values, and log them to the console for debugging purposes.</p>

                <p>Check to see if the username is "admin" and the password is "password" if it is, return a JSON object with a <code>success</code> value set to <code>true</code>. If you do not receive these values, return a JSON object with <code>success</code> set to <code>false</code>.</p>

                <p>Verify that you get the expected results on the HTML page. Please note that nothing is being stored on the session yet.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Change your <code>/login</code> so that if the correct username and password are received it stores the username on the session.</p>

                <p>Implement the <code>/logout</code> method. It should first check if the username is on the session. If it is, it should destroy the session and return a JSON object with a <code>success</code> value set to <code>true</code>. If the username is not present on the session, return a JSON object with <code>success</code> set to <code>false</code>.</p>

                <p>Verify that your functions work as expected (e.g., try logging out before loggin in and verify that you cannot, etc.).</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Create a Get route for <code>/getServerTime</code> that returns a JSON object with a <code>success</code> value set to <code>true</code> and a <code>time</code> attribute set to the server time. You get get the server time with code like: <code>var time = new Date();</code>. Ensure that your Web service works and displays the correct time on the HTML page.</p>

                <p>Now, create two middleware functions. First, create a function called <code>logRequest</code>. Set up this function to log the requested URL with code like: <code>console.log("Received a request for: " + request.url);</code>. Now "use" this middleware function so that it is invoked for all requests. Don't forget to call "next" at the end of the function. Verify that it is invoked and logs data on the server when you request your different endpoints.</p>

                <p>Finally, create a middleware function called <code>verifyLogin</code>. It should check to see if a username is on the session. If it is, simply call "next()" to let the request pipeline carry on. If it is not on the session, send back a JSON message with an error message, and a status code of 401 to indicate that it is unauthorized.</p>

                <p>Add this middleware function to the route for <code>/getServerTime</code> so that it only returns the server time if the user is logged in. If the user is not logged in, they should get the 401 message. Verify that this works from your html page.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Stretch Challenges</h4>
        <p>After finishing the core requirements, ensure that everyone is at that point and understands the material. When everyone has completed the core requirements, you can move on to these stretch challenges.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Create a database with a table containing a username and password. Have your login function check the username and password against this table.</p></li>
            <li><p>Use the bcrypt library to store hashed passwords in the table instead of plain text passwords.</p></li>
            <li><p>If you get this far, congratulate yourself on working through a really tough team activity!</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Instructor's Solution</h3>
        <p>As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one. One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide insights from this comparison.</p>

        <p>Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core requirements, if you code them up yourself.</p>

        <p>After working with your team for the one hour activity, <a href="https://github.com/byui-burton/cs313-course-dev/tree/master/week12/ta-solution/" target="_blank">click here for the instructor's solution</a>.</p>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment in I-Learn. You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before submitting the assessment.</p>
