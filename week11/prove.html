        <h2>11 Prove : Assignment - Milestone 2</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Build the client side interaction of your site.</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>For this week's assignment, you will be working on your individual project.</p>

        <p>You don't necessarily have to complete every component of your application this week, but at a minimum, you should have the HTML in place for some basic functionality, and use AJAX to call into at least a few of your services and update the page accordingly.</p>        

        <p>Since every project is different, your specific deliverable for this milestone may vary. However, in general you should consider two main topics this week:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Build-out the main user interface in more detail, using AJAX calls to consume the Web services you created last week.</p>
                <p>Ideally, last week you were able to get at least one request working from end-to-end, but it may be that your UI interface surrounding it was somewhat primitive. The goal this week is implement the UI in a way that is more in line with how you want the application to function in the end.</p></li>
            <li>
                <p>In addition to the UI work this week, it would be good to implement a few more of your Web service endpoints this week. Please try to get at least one POST request implemented this week, if you have only done the GET requests to this point.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
