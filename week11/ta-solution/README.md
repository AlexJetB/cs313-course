# Team Activity Solution

For the solution this week, there are three separate variants shown:

- One that uses vanilla (built-in) JavaScript and the XmlHttpRequest approach.
- One that uses the new "fetch" approach that is now built-in to JavaScript as well.
- One that uses jQuery.

There are pros/cons to these approaches, and any of them are fine for this semester.
