        <h2>10 Prove : Assignment - Milestone 1</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Build out your data layer and expose the web services your application requires.</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>For this week's assignment, you will be working on your individual project. Your task is to build out the data layer of your project and complete the web service endpoints that you specified in your design.</p>

        <div class="tips">
        <p>Instructor Tips</p>
        <p>Don't get discouraged if getting your first endpoint takes a little while. When completing a task like this, I find that 80% of the work goes into completing the first one. Once that is done, the others usually follow the same process and come together nicely.</p>
        <p>Also, when you are going end-to-end like this from the web service to the database and back, there are a ton of things that can go wrong! I always try to get the simplest possible case to go from end to end first, and then work on expanding it to the actual data I need.</p>
        </div>

        <p>As you get deeper into your project, it is likely that you will need to make changes to what you originally planned. This is natural and expected. For this and future milestone submissions, you should do what is best for your project, even if that is different than what you originally designed.</p>
