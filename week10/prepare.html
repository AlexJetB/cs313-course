        <h2>10 Prepare : Reading</h2>

        <h3>Preparation Material</h3>
        <p>As a foundation, please go through the following:</p>

        <p>1. <a href="https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-restful/" target="_blank">An overview of what a REST API</a> is and some best practices to keep in mind.</p>

        <p>2. <a href="https://familysearch.org/developers/docs/guides/oauth2" target="_blank">An overview of the OAuth 2.0 authorization process from FamilySearch.</a> (This gives a nice overview of the process and will likely be very similar to whatever API you use).</p>
        <p>3. The last piece of required reading is to find the API documentation for your specific application and read over the authentication section (like the above one for FamilySearch). Many of these pages have example source code that you can cut and paste and Tweak for your application. Look especially for a section discussing connecting from a server (which you will be doing) and in the Java language.</p>
        <p>You should also look to see if there is a Java specific client library for your resource. Many of the common libraries have them (Facebook4J, Twitter4J, etc.). This will likely be a JAR file that you download and include in your project that defines Java classes corresponding to the business objects you will use, and will also handle the direct interaction with the API for you.</p>
        <p>4. Please find and read the terms and conditions of the API/company you will be working with.</p>
        <p>5. In addition, <a href="./prepare-facebook.html" target="_blank">see this example</a> that shows how to walk through the Oauth 2.0 handshaking process and connect to the Facebook API which requires this authentication. You do not need to work through this tutorial before meeting with your team for your weekly activity, however, it may be helpful to reference as you work on your team projects. Even if you are not using the Facebook API, if yours requires Oauth 2.0 authentication, the process will be very similar.</p>
