        <h3>Preparation Material</h3>
        <p>The preparation material this week is different than in weeks past.</p>
        <p>For this week, your assignment is to learn about a new web technology that we have not discussed in class (and that you have not used previously), and come prepared to discuss it.</p>
        <p>Specifically, be prepared to talk about points such as the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>What is the main purpose of this technology (what was it designed for)?</p></li>
            <li><p>What are some of its strengths and weaknesses compared to others that are designed for a similar purpose?</p></li>
            <li><p>What are some of its limitations and areas where it should not be applied?</p></li>
            <li><p>How does it compare to or possibly integrate with some of the technologies we have discussed in this course?</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>You need not prepare a formal presentation, and you shouldn&rsquo;t spend hours upon hours on this research, but it should be more than a quick 20 minute skim.
