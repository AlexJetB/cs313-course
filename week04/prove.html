  <h2>04 Prove : Assignment - DB Setup</h2>

  <h3>Overview</h3>

  <p>Create the database for your PHP Project.</p>
  <h3>Guidelines</h3>
  <p>For this assignment, you need to have the schema in place for your database (e.g., create the tables and the
    relationships between them). You are not required to have the tables populated with data just yet (although,
    depending on your application, it might be a good idea to get some of this in place sooner than later).</p>

  <p>Please consider the following guidelines regarding this assignment:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><p>Create a database on your server.</p></li>
    <li><p>Create the tables you will need for your project.</p></li>
    <li><p>Choose appropriate data types for each column.</p></li>
    <li><p>Ensure that each table has an appropriate primary key.</p></li>
    <li><p>Include foreign key constraints wherever possible.</p></li>
    <li><p>Eliminate data redundancy wherever possible.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Saving your SQL commands</h3>
  <p>Please create a directory under your application directory (as a sibling to the <code>web</code> directory) called <code>db</code> and put a text file in that directory called myDb.sql, or something similar. You should put all of the commands necessary to create your database into this file. (You don't want to put this file under the <code>web</code> directory, because you don't want it available to everyone that will view your website.)</p>

  <p>While you can type your SQL commands right into the console, it is usually better to type them into a text editor and copy and paste them into the console. This way, if you have a syntax error, it is much easier to fix the code in another editor and re-copy and paste.</p>

  <p>Also, then when you are done working through your commands, you will have a file with all the SQL commands needed to create your complete database. On projects in industry, you will often see more formality around this process, but you will see the same general practice of having a script that can create the structure of your complete database.</p>

  <p>The submission file below will contain a link to your .sql file.</p>
