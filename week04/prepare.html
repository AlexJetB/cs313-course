  <h3>Preparation Material</h3>

  <p>To prepare for the weekly team activity, before meeting with your group, please read the following tutorials:</p>

  <p>If this is your first dose of databases, you should also work through the sections marked optional here.</p>

  <ol>
    <li><p>Watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z2kbsG8zsLM" target="_blank">this short video</a> introducing
      relational databases. (<a href="./transcripts/An-Introduction-to-Relational-Databases.rtf">transcript</a>)</p>
    </li>

    <li><p>Follow <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/tutorial.html" target="_blank">this tutorial</a>.
      It will walk you through the basics of creating a new database, putting a table into it, filling it with data and
      selecting it. I would strongly recommend doing these basic commands on your own database as you go through it.</p>

      <div class="tips">
        <p>Instructor Tips:</p>
        <p>Remember that if you have installed WAPP/MAPP/etc, then you have already installed Postgres and you don't need to repeat it as part of this
        tutorial. If your command to create the DB fails, it may be that the postgres applications (createdb and psql) are not in your system path, i.e. the place your computer looks for programs to run. To fix this, you'll need to either type the full path of the program (e.g., C:/Users/Wappstack/.../postgres/bin/createdb or something similar), or you will need to add that folder to your path environment variable.</p>
        <p>Similarly, if you have problems logging into your database, it may be that you have not supplied the postgres user name. This is done by passing it on the command line, like so: "createdb -U postgres" replacing postgres with whatever username your installer created, but in my case, it was simply "postgres". Then, you'll need to know the password you set up when you installed the database.</p>
      </div>
    </li>

    <li><p>(Optional) If you are familiar with the many-to-many relationships, you may skip this video, but otherwise,
      watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVOxPo598Y0" target="_blank">this short video</a> (<a
        href="./transcripts/Many-to-Many-Relationships.rtf">transcript</a>) outlining the concepts of many-to-many
      relationships.</p></li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Creating a Postgres database on Heroku</h3>

  <p>Instead of using the standard Postgres createdb and psql commands, the Heroku CLI provides some easy shortcuts for
    creating and interacting with a Postgres database in your Cloud application.</p>

  <p>Make sure to run these commands from the parent directory of application code to get the full Heroku context.</p>

  <p>The following commands will create a free instance of Postgres on Heroku and retrieve details.</p>

  <pre><code class="bash">
$ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
Creating heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev on â¬¢ afternoon-mesa-40442... free
Database has been created and is available
 ! This database is empty. If upgrading, you can transfer
 ! data from another database with pg:copy
Created postgresql-colorful-90657 as DATABASE_URL
Use heroku addons:docs heroku-postgresql to view documentation
</code></pre>

  <pre><code class="bash">
$ heroku config -s
DATABASE_URL='postgres://cgojnkcoqncmxf:e510ef76e9f981ffd3069afa499c4d2bd748c1f2ea77e9da50f906dbe8f8c3e1@ec2-23-21-184-181.compute-1.amazonaws.com:5432/dfnorfi59oivff'
</code></pre>

  <pre><code class="bash">
$ heroku pg:info

</code></pre>

  <p>The following Heroku CLI command provides all of the required parameters to automatically connect to your Postgres database in Heroku.</p>

  <pre><code class="bash">
$ heroku pg:psql
--> Connecting to postgresql-colorful-90657

Type "help" for help.
