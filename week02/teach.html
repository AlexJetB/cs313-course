            <h4>Special Instructions for Online Students</h4>

            <p>This week, because you are still in the process of forming teams and coordinating your weekly meeting time, you will NOT complete this activity with your teams.</p>

            <p>However, to help you understand the process of how the team activities will work each week, you will still complete this activity including the assessment in I-Learn. For this week's assessment, you can answer "True" to the questions about arriving on-time to the meeting with your team, and actively participating with them. Thus, you will see the expectation for the team activities for each week in the future.</p>

            <p>Even though you will be completing this week's activity individually, please help one another in the developer's forum.</p>
