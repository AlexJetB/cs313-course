        <h2>02 Teach : Team Activity</h2>

        <div class="online-notes">

            <h4>Special Instructions for Online Students</h4>

            <p>This week, because you are still in the process of forming teams and coordinating your weekly meeting time, you will NOT complete this activity with your teams.</p>

            <p>However, to help you understand the process of how the team activities will work each week, you will still complete this activity including the assessment in I-Learn. For this week's assessment, you can answer "True" to the questions about arriving on-time to the meeting with your team, and actively participating with them. Thus, you will see the expectation for the team activities for each week in the future.</p>

            <p>Even though you will be completing this week's activity individually, please help one another in the developer's forum.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>For this assignment we will be reviewing client-side HTML constructs.</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>Complete the following assignment as a team. Designate one team member as the "main driver" and collaborate on their copy of the code. Everyone on the team should be actively engaged in writing the code and contributing to the solution. Once the solution is working, make sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code and everyone successfully deploys the code to their individual Heroku accounts. Each week let someone else be the "main driver" of the coding.</p>

        <p>Create an HTML page according to the following:</p>

        <h4>Core Requirements</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Create an HTML page with a head element that provides a title for your page, and links to external CSS and JavaScript files.</p>
                <p>On the HTML page, create 3 divs and a button labeled "Click Me".</p>
                <p>Add classes and/or ids to your divs, then use the CSS to set their font-size and background color. Add function in your JavaScript file to alert the text "Clicked!", and have your button call this function when it is clicked.</p>
            </li>

            <li><p>Use CSS to make it so that hovering over any of the 3 divs causes the text to temporarily become bold.</p></li>

            <li><p>Make it so that the user can specify custom colors for the first div. To accomplish this, add a text box and another button labeled "Change color". Write a JavaScript function that gets invoked by clicking this button that gets the text from the textbox and sets the color of the first div.</p></li>

        </ol>

        <h4>Stretch Challenges</h4>
        <p>Please make sure everyone on your team is caught up with the concepts of the core requirements, before moving onto the stretch challenges.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Repeat the previous step (changing the background color to the value in the box), but this time, use jQuery instead of vanilla JavaScript.</p></li>

            <li><p>Add another button to toggle the visibility of the third div. Use jQuery to make it slowly fade in and fade out, rather than just turning on and off.</p></li>

            <li><p>Try out <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>. Use bootstrap styles to make it so that your three divs look <em>nice</em>, and respond well when the page is resized.</p></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Instructor's Solution</h3>
        <p>As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one. One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide insights from this comparison.</p>

        <p>Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core requirements, if you code them up yourself.</p>

        <p>After working with your team for the one hour activity, <a href="https://github.com/byui-cs/cs313-course/tree/master/week02/ta-solution/" target="_blank">click here for the instructor's solution</a>.</p>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment in I-Learn.</p>

        <p>You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before submitting the assessment.</p>
