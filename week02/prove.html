        <h2>02 Prove : Assignment - Personal Homepage</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>The purpose of this assignment is to review a minimal level of client-side programming and provide a homepage from which you can link to future assignments.</p>

        <h3>Guidelines</h3>
        <p>For this assignment you are to create a personal homepage that will be a landing page for you for the rest of the course.</p>

        <p>For this site, you should have at least two pages: first, an introduction to yourself or something you are interested in, and second, a page that will have links to assignments. At this point, the assignments page can say "Coming soon" or something similar.</p>

        <p>For privacy reasons, you do not need to include personal or identifying information on your homepage. You are welcome to highlight yourself, if you so choose, but we would be just as happy to see something about breast cancer awareness, Pokemon, golf, or wherever your interests lie.</p>

        <h4>Minimum Standards:</h4>
        <p>The following guidelines are a minimum standard for this assignment (required for a 93%). To earn a 100% on the assignment, you will need to go above and beyond this standard to show your creativity and ingenuity.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Professional look and feel</p></li>
            <li><p>Do not use an HTML generator/layout program (e.g., DreamWeaver, FrontPage, Visual Studio designer tools). Please write the HTML for this page from scratch. You are, however, welcome to use jQuery, or Bootstrap, or other libraries if you would like.</p></li>
            <li><p>Put all styles in an external stylesheet. (No inline styles.)</p></li>
            <li><p>At least one image</p></li>
            <li><p>Something dynamic (e.g., mouse-overs, menus, on-click, on-change, etc.)</p></li>
            <li><p>Include reasonable colors, images, etc. to show your creativity and personality (but don't forget to keep it somewhat professional).</p></li>
            <li><p>No run-time errors</p></li>
            <li><p>Use PHP to do <em>something</em> on the server.</p>
                <ul><li><p>While most of this assignment is about reviewing client side Web development, you ought to make your page a .php file, and do at least one thing on the server (i.e. inside <code>&lt;?php ... ?&gt;</code> tags). This could be as simple as displaying the server time, or another common option is to use a php include to include the same header or navbar on each page. The exact things you do are up to you.</p></li></ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As always, you are strongly encouraged to go above and beyond these guidelines.</p>
        
        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>After completing these steps, please push your code to your server and update the Student Wiki to point to your new homepage (if the URL is different than your "Hello World" page).</p>

        <p>Finally, download this assignment's <a href="./prove02.txt" target="_blank">submission form</a>, fill it out, and submit it to I-Learn.</p>
