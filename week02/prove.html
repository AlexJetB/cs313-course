        <h2>02 Prove : Assignment - Personal Homepage</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>The purpose of this assignment is to review a minimal level of client-side programming and provide a homepage from which you can link to future assignments.</p>

        <h3>Guidelines</h3>
        <p>The following guidelines are a minimum standard for this assignment (required for a 93%). To earn a 100% on the assignment, you will need to go above and beyond this standard to show your creativity and ingenuity.</p>
        <h4>Minimum Standards:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Professional look and feel</p></li>
            <li><p>Do not use an HTML generator/layout program (e.g., DreamWeaver, FrontPage, Visual Studio designer tools). Please write the HTML for this page from scratch. You are, however, welcome to use jQuery, or Bootstrap, or other libraries if you would like.</p></li>
            <li><p>Put all styles in an external stylesheet. (No inline styles.)</p></li>
            <li><p>Have at least two pages: one as an introduction to yourself and one that will have links to assignments. (For now the assignments page can say "Coming soon" or something similar).</p></li>
            <li><p>At least one image</p></li>
            <li><p>Something dynamic (e.g., mouse-overs, menus, on-click, on-change, etc.)</p></li>
            <li><p>Include reasonable colors, images, etc. to show your creativity and personality (but don't forget to keep it somewhat professional).</p></li>
            <li><p>No run-time errors</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>As always, you are strongly encouraged to go above and beyond these guidelines.</p>
        
        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>After completing these steps, please push your code to your server and update the Student Wiki to point to your new homepage (if the URL is different than your "Hello World" page).</p>

        <p>Finally, download this assignment's <a href="./prove02.txt" target="_BLANK">submission form</a>, fill it out, and submit it to I-Learn.</p>
