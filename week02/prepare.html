  <h2>02 Prepare : Reading</h2>

  <h3>Background Information</h3>
  <p>Before your team activity this week. Please read the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_intro.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools PHP Tutorial</a> (Read the
      pages from "PHP Intro" to "PHP Superglobals.")</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Classroom Examples (Optional)</h3>
    <p>Sometimes in the classroom we work through a particular example together, and it has been helpful for the online students to see that example, and for the campus students to go back and review it later. To help with this, we have recorded a few of these and made them available here. They aren't necessarily scripted or polished, but rather, are an attempt to give you the kind of discussion that would be in the classroom. They are optional, supplementary material that you are welcome to use inasmuch as they are helpful to you.</p>
