  <h2>02 Prepare : Reading</h2>

  <h3>Background Information</h3>
  <p>Before your team activity this week. Please read the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_intro.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools PHP Tutorial</a> (Read the
      pages from "PHP Intro" to "PHP Superglobals.")</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Get familiar with your Local Server</h3>
  <p>Last week, you installed Apache and PHP, but likely didn't get a chance to play around with PHP much. Even though PHP is not required for this week's assignment, you should begin familiarizing yourself with it. And you will need to for your team activity and assignment next week.</p>

  <div class="tips">
    <p>Instructor Tip:</p>
    <p>In the root directory of your WAPP/MAPP/LAPP installation you will find a <em>README.txt</em> file that includes,
      along with other good information, a section on starting and stopping Apache and Postgres.</p>
  </div>

  <p>Please refer to <a href="./prepare-local-server-test.html">Running PHP on Your Local Server</a> for more information about running a PHP file using your local server configuration.</p>
