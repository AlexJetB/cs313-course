  <h2>02 Prepare : Reading</h2>

  <h3>Background Information</h3>
  <p>Before your team activity this week. Please read the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_intro.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools PHP Tutorial</a> (Read the
      pages from "PHP Intro" to "PHP Superglobals.")</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Set Up Local Environment</h3>
  <p>You could do all of your development and testing right on your server, but this can be a little cumbersome, and you
    may want to debug your application a little more thoroughly before you make it available to the world. Thus, it is
    nice to have a development environment on your local machine, and then you can push your changes to the server when
    they are ready to deploy.</p>
  <p>For the first half of the semester, we will be using PHP 5.x with the Apache HTTP Server and Postgres databases.
    There are some nice (free) packages that will help you install and set up these tools on your laptop. It is
    recommended that you download and install one. (If presented with an option, select the 5.x versions instead of the
    7.x versions as they include the desired 5.x version of PHP.)</p>
  <p>Windows: WAPP - <a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/wapp" target="_blank">https://bitnami.com/stack/wapp</a></p>
  <p>Mac: MAPP - <a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/mapp" target="_blank">https://bitnami.com/stack/mapp</a></p>
  <p>Linux: LAPP - <a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/lapp" target="_blank">https://bitnami.com/stack/lapp</a></p>
  <p>While this is not required to create your home page (this week's assignment), it would be good to start playing
    around with PHP on your own computer, and you will need to have this in place for the team activity and assignment
    next week.</p>
