        <h2>02 Teach : Team Activity</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>For this assignment we will be practicing PHP fundamentals.</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>With your team, complete the following assignment. You will create only one page, but each of you should be actively engaged in writing the code and contributing to the solution. Then, at the end of the activity make sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code that you wrote. Each week, we will switch to let someone else be the "main driver" of the keyboard.</p>

        <h4>Core Requirements</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p></p>
            </li>

            <li><p></p></li>

            <li><p></p></li>

        </ol>

        <h4>Stretch Challenges</h4>
        <p>Please make sure everyone on your team is caught up with the concepts of the core requirements, before moving onto the stretch challenges.</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p></p></li>

            <li><p></p></li>

            <li><p></p></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Instructor's Solution</h3>
        <p>As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one. One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide insights from this comparison.</p>

        <p>Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core requirements, if you code them up yourself.</p>

        <p>After working with your team for the one hour activity, <a href="https://github.com/byui-burton/cs313-course-dev/tree/master/week02/ta-solution-f2f/" target="_blank">click here for the instructor's solution</a>.</p>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment in I-Learn.</p>

        <p>You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before submitting the assessment.</p>
