        <h2>02 Teach : Team Activity</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>For this assignment we will be practicing PHP fundamentals.</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>With your team, complete the following assignment. You will create only one page, but each of you should be actively engaged in writing the code and contributing to the solution. Then, at the end of the activity make sure that everyone on the team gets a copy of the code that you wrote. Each week, we will switch to let someone else be the "main driver" of the keyboard.</p>

        <h4>Core Requirements</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Create a PHP web application with three pages:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>about-us.php - Come up with a topic for a fictitious company, and create an "About Us" page that describes your company.</p></li>
                    <li><p>home.php - This page should welcome the user to your site. Later it will be updated to include the user's login name, but for now, it can just say, "Welcome. You are not logged in."</p></li>
                    <li><p>login.php - This page should have two links or buttons on it: "Log in as Administrator", "Log in as Tester".</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Verify that you can load each of your pages in a browser using the "localhost" URL.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Add a common header / navbar for all of your pages. It should display your fictitious company's name, and have links to the three pages. Create this header as a separate PHP file that can be included by each of the three pages.</p>

            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Change the navbar so that the current page is highlighted in some way (e.g., when you are on the about page, the background color for the "about" link is different.).
            </li>

        </ol>

        <h4>Stretch Challenges</h4>
        <p>Please make sure everyone on your team is caught up with the concepts of the core requirements, before moving onto the stretch challenges.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Make it so that the login buttons you created on the login page store the name "Administrator" or "Tester" as a session variable. This may require you to create an additional PHP script(s) to handle the login. Don't worry about making it a form with passwords or anything at this point.</p>
                <p>After logging the user in, have the web application automatically redirect them to the home page. Then update the page to display their username (i.e., "Administrator" or "Tester".</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Add a Logout button or link to the home page. This should remove any session variables.</p>
                <p>Update the home page to automatically redirect the user to the login page if no user is logged in.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Deploy this site to one of your Heroku accounts.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Instructor's Solution</h3>
        <p>As a part of this team activity, you are expected to look over a solution from the instructor, to compare your approach to that one. One of the questions on the I-Learn submission will ask you to provide insights from this comparison.</p>

        <p>Please DO NOT open the solution until you have worked through this activity as a team for the one hour period. At the end of the hour, if you are still struggling with some of the core requirements, you are welcome to view the instructor's solution and use it to help you complete your own code. Even if you use the instructor's code to help you, you are welcome to report that you finished the core requirements, if you code them up yourself.</p>

        <p>After working with your team for the one hour activity, <a href="https://github.com/byui-burton/cs313-course-dev/tree/master/week02/ta-solution-f2f/" target="_blank">click here for the instructor's solution</a>.</p>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>When you have finished this activity, please fill out the assessment in I-Learn.</p>

        <p>You are welcome to complete any additional parts of this activity by yourself or with others after your meeting before submitting the assessment.</p>
