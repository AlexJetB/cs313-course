        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>Build the client side interaction of your site.</p>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <p>For this week's assignment, you will be working on your individual project. Your task is build the main user interface and then use AJAX calls to consume the Web services you created last week.</p>

        <p>You don't necessarily have to complete every component of your application this week, but at a minimum, you should have the HTML in place for the basic functionality, and use AJAX to call into at least a few of your services and update the page accordingly.</p>
