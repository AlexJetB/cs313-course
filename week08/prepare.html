        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>For this week, we will begin our study of JavaScript and Node.js.</p>

        <h3>Infrastructure Setup</h3>
        <p>Your first preparation task this week is to download and install Node.js on your local computer. This will enable you to run JavaScript files directly, and as we progress, you will host a Web server with it.</p>

        <p>Next week, we will also configure a Node.js server at Heroku, but for this week, you only need to install it locally.</p>

        <p>Here is the link to the Node.js website: <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">nodejs.org</a>. Please follow their instructions to download and install on your operating system.</p>

        <h3>Reading</h3>
        <p>If you are new to Node.js or advanced JavaScript programming, one of the biggest things that takes some getting used to is the idea of asynchronous programming and callback functions.</p>

        <p>To help you get started, after setting up your infrastructure. Please read the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p><a href="https://github.com/maxogden/art-of-node#callbacks" target="_blank">The Art of Node : Callbacks</a> - The whole thing is good (and not too long), but make sure to read at least the section on Callbacks.</p></li>
            <li><p><a href="http://callbackhell.com/" target="_blank">Callback Hell</a></p></li>
        </ol>

        <p>Depending on your familiarity with JavaScript from previous classes, you may also want to spend some time reviewing the fundamentals of JavaScript in preparation for this week.</p>

        <h3>Additional Topics for This Week</h3>

        <p>Finally, please read: <a href="./prepare-nTier.html" target="_blank">n-Tier Architecture Pattern Overview</a>.</p>

    <h3>Classroom Examples (Optional)</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p><a href="https://video.byui.edu/media/313-08-node-intro/0_q5w40x5i" target="_blank">Intro to Node.js</a> (12 mins)</p></li>
