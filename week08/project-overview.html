        <h2>08 Prepare : Project 2 Idea Submission</h2>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>For the second half of the semester we will be building web applications using Node.js. As with our PHP project in the first half of the semester, this will be an extended project that will drive the assignments and much of our learning for the rest of the semester.</p>

        <p>Your assignment this week is to decide on a general idea for the project. Next week, you will outline it in more detail.</p>

        <h3>Basic Guidelines</h3>
        <p>One of the strengths of Node.js is its ability to expose web services which can then be consumed by client-side AJAX. The client-side code could be using a framework, such as Angular or React, or could be native JavaScript.</p>

        <p>Along these lines, your project will be a full stack Node.js project that uses Web Services for the communication between the client and the server. We will not be using client-side frameworks for this project, but after completing it, you will be very well prepared to use them for future endeavors.</p>

        <h4>Guidelines</h4>
        <p>As with Project 1, you can choose the topic of your application. Your project will be evaluated as to how well it:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><p>Presents a professional look and feel</p></li>
            <li><p>Accomplishes a meaningful task / does something interesting</p></li>
            <li><p>Demonstrates understanding of Node.js and Express principles</p></li>
            <li><p>Demonstrates mastery of Client-side and Server-side communication</p></li>
            <li><p>Incorporates a data layer composed of either a DB (e.g., PostgreSQL) and/or third-party web services (e.g., Walmart, Twitter, FamilySearch, etc.).</p></li>

<!-- These were from before...

        <li><p>Demonstrate understanding of asynchronous callback functions.</p></li>
        <li><p>Handle authentication and persistence of state.</p></li>
-->
        </ol>

        <h4>Single Page Applications</h4>
        <p>Single Page Applications (SPAs) are a great example of applications that fit this architecture. These are applications where the user stays on the same HTML page, but the page is manipulated by client-side JavaScript to provide the desired experience.</p>

<!-- Took this out, because I thought it would sound too much like I was suggesting re-working a Project 1 idea.

         <p>Almost all the projects considered by the class for Project 1 would work well as a single page application.</p>
 -->

<!-- I don't want to bias them with these ideas
        <p>The following ideas are some examples to get you thinking. You do not have to pick from this list, nor is it intended to be comprehensive.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p><heading>Math/reading game</heading> - Allows a user to log in and track their progress. Various problems and solutions are stored in a the database and retrieved based on the user's current status.</p></li>

            <li><p><heading></heading></p></li>
        </ul>
 -->

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>Please submit to I-Learn a 1-2 paragraph description of your project.</p>
