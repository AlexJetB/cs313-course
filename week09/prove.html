        <h2>09 Prove : Assignment - Postal Rate Calculator</h2>

        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>Create a Node.js site, using the Express framework, and deploy it to Heroku.</p>

        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>Use Node.js and Express to create a web application that determines the postage required for a single piece of retail first-class mail. You should have a form that allows a user to specify 1) the weight of the item and then 2) select one of the following types of mail:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><p>Letters (Stamped)</p></li>
            <li><p>Letters (Metered)</p></li>
            <li><p>Large Envelopes (Flats)</p></li>
            <li><p>Parcels</p></li>
        </ul>

        <p>After submitting the form, the user is taken to a page that displays the information they submitted along with the resulting price.</p>

        <p>The rates can be found on <a href="http://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/Notice123.htm" target="_blank">this page</a> from the USPS website. Under the "Retail Prices" section, click on the link for "First-Class Mail".</p>

        <h3>Guidelines</h3>

        <p>The following steps are a suggested path to completing this assignment.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Refer to the <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#introduction" target="_blank">Heroku Node.js Tutorial</a> steps for how to create and deploy a simple Node.js app.</p>
                <p>The steps to creating an app and deploying are very similar to the processing of doing so for PHP applications. You won't need many of the items in this tutorial, such as setting up scaling, etc., but the first few steps should get you on the right track.</p>
                <p>In particular cloning their getting started repo from GitHub will give you a nice place to start.</p>
                <div class="tips">
                    <p>Instructor Tips</p>
                    <p>These steps attempt to walk you through this process, but I would strongly recommend getting the simplest possible things to work and then adding to them, bit by bit.</p>
                    <p>So for this step, for example, you should consider getting the starter template cloned to your local machine, and see that you can run node.js on it, and view it in a browser at local host. Then, once that is working, follow the steps to deploy it to Heroku, pull it up in a browser, and make sure that is working. When those are in place, you should then proceed to add other elements as outlined below.</p>
                </div>
            </li>
            <li><p>Create a static html page with your form on it. See Getting Started material on the official <a href="http://expressjs.com/" target="_blank">Express site</a> for more information about using static files.</p></li>
            <li>
                <p>Create an .ejs page to display your response. At first, have it just render plain html with hard coded values. Then, set up a route to have something like "/getRate" render the .ejs page (in other words, your .ejs file is really just an HTML file with a different extension). Look at the index.js page in the getting started code for an example of how they configured a route for "/" to render the "pages/index" .ejs page.</p>
                <p>Once you have this page in place, you should be able to pull it up directly in a browser. Then verify that your form can also post to it (even though it doesn't use the values from the form yet).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create a function called calculateRate in your JavaScript that accepts a mail type and a weight, and returns the appropriate postage. Start by calling this function with hardcoded values, and log the result to the console. Then, once that is working you can work to get the correct values from the form submission</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>Once you are getting the correct values from the form submission to your calculateRate function, you need to find a way to get the result to render on your .ejs page. To learn how to do this, you might try searching the Web for things like "pass values from node to ejs".</p></li>
            
            <li>
                <p>Deploy your application to Heroku and verify that it works there.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Create a new repository at GitHub, add it as another remote for your directory (e.g., <code>git remote add github https://github.com/user/repo-name</code>). Then, push your code to GitHub.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Going above and beyond</h3>
        <p>Think of ways you can dress up your application with more advanced functionality, more advanced ways of handling the requests, or anything else you would like to learn more about.</p>

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>Download this assignment's <a href="./prove09.txt" target="_blank">submission form</a>, fill it out, and submit it to I-Learn as well.</p>
