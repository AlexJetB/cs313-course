    <h3>Simple JSP/Servlet Tutorial</h3>

        <h4>OBJECTIVE</h4>
        <p>Demonstrate a very simplistic interaction between a JSP and a servlet.</p>

        <h4>EXAMPLE</h4>
        <p>For this example, consider a form that allows the user to submit two numbers. The server then computes the sum and returns HTML with the result.</p>
        <p>Note: This tutorial is showing the process with Eclipse and Tomcat 7, but the same pieces work just as well in NetBeans with GlassFish. The menu items (such as to create a new project) are slightly different, but the files and the processes themselves are the same.</p>

    <h3>Create the Project in Eclipse</h3>
        <p>First, we start by creating a dynamic web application in Eclipse. File &gt; New &gt; Dynamic Web Project Type in the name "sum", make sure Tomcat v.7 is selected as the target runtime.</p>

    <h3>Create the Submission Form</h3>
        <p>Let's start by creating a simple JSP for our submission form. In the IDE, expand the "sum" project, right-click the WebContent folder, and select New &gt; JSP File. Choose a name such as "submitNumbers.jsp", and select finish.</p>
        <p><i>Note that because the form does not require any dynamic content, it doesn't actually need to be a JSP file at all, and could be a simple ".html" page. But if in the future, we want to have dynamic content on the page (e.g., display a logged in user at the top, etc.) we could make it a JSP file from the beginning.</i></p>
        <p>Change the title of the new page to be "Number Submission", and create a simple form with two text boxes, by copying the following content into the body:</p>

<pre><code class="html">
&lt;form action="ComputeSum" method="GET"&gt;
    First Number: &lt;input type="text" name="first" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    Second Number: &lt;input type="text" name="second" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;input type="submit" value="Compute Sum" /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
</code></pre>

        <p>The complete page should now look as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="html">
&lt;%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" pageEncoding="UTF-8"%&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"&gt;

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Number Submission&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

    &lt;form action="ComputeSum" method="GET"&gt;
        First Number: &lt;input type="text" name="first" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
        Second Number: &lt;input type="text" name="second" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
        &lt;input type="submit" value="Compute Sum" /&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

        <p>Notice that the form submission specifies "ComputeSum" as its action. This refers to a servlet that we must now write to compute the sum.</p>

    <h3>Create ComputeSum Servlet</h3>
        <p>In the IDE, right-click the project and select New &gt; Servlet, type a package name, such as "calculations" and then the name of the class as "ComputeSum". This creates a new class shown under Java Resources &gt; src &gt; calculations &gt; ComputeSum.java .</p>
    <p>Before the declaration of the new servlet class, notice the annotation: <code>@WebServlet("/ComputeSum")</code>. This means that our servlet will be invoked for URLs matching "ComputeSum". This is why we specified "ComputeSum" as the action for our form. Notice that it is simply "ComputeSum" with no extension such as ".java".</p>
        <p>Because the method on our form was "GET", we need to fill in the logic of our doGet Method. Inside that method, we first need to get the two form variables. These can be accessed via the request object as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="java">request.getParameter("first");
</code></pre>

        <p>To convert it to an integer, we can use the Integer.parseInt method, as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="java">int num1 = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("first"));
int num2 = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("second"));
int sum = num1 + num2;
</code></pre>

        <p>We can now compute the sum, and could use the response writer object to write the complete response back to the user. But it is much easier (and better design) to process the data in Java in the servlet, but then pass the data to a JSP page to render it. In the Model View Controller pattern, this lets the servlet function as the Controller, and the JSP as the View (in this case the model is almost non-existent because it would be essentially just the "sum" variable).</p>
        <p>To make the sum available to the JSP page, we need to pass it somehow. This can be done by adding it as an additional attribute on the request object, then forwarding the request on to the JSP.</p>
        <p>Attributes can be placed on the request object as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="java">request.setAttribute("sum", sum);
</code></pre>

        <p>where the first parameter is the key (a String) and the second is the value to be stored.</p>
        <p>Then, execution can be forwarded to the JSP page as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="java">request.getRequestDispatcher("/result.jsp").forward(request, response);
</code></pre>

        <p>This forwards execution to a JSP file named "result.jsp" and gives it access to the request and response object. Note that the request object has the GET parameters, as well as an attribute with the computed sum.</p>
        <p>The complete servlet now looks as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="java">package calculations;
import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

/**
 * Servlet implementation class ComputeSum
 */
@WebServlet("/ComputeSum")
public class ComputeSum extends HttpServlet {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    /**
     * @see HttpServlet#HttpServlet()
     */
    public ComputeSum() {
        super();
        // TODO Auto-generated constructor stub
    }

    /**
     * @see HttpServlet#doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
     */
    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {

        int num1 = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("first"));
        int num2 = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("second"));

        int sum = num1 + num2;
        request.setAttribute("sum", sum);

        request.getRequestDispatcher("/result.jsp").forward(request, response);
    }

}
</code></pre>

        <h3>Handling the Result in a JSP</h3>
        <p>From the last section, we now have a servlet handling the "business logic" of the application, and passing data on to a JSP to display the results.</p>
        <p>To create the results page, first expand to the "WebContent" folder in the IDE, right-click, and select New &gt; JSP file. Type the name "result.jsp" and click Finish. Then on the JSP page, change the title to "Results Page" or something similar.</p>
        <p>We can now fill in the body of the document with the data from the request object. To access this data, we can use the Expression Langage (EL) syntax, as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="html">
${param.first}
</code></pre>

        <p>This will get the request parameter named "first" which in this case refers to the parameter submitted from the form. Similarly, we can access the "sum" attribute that we added, in a similar way:</p>

<pre><code class="html">
${requestScope.sum}
</code></pre>

    <p>Because there is no ambiguity between variables of different scopes with this name (e.g., there is not a session variable also named "sum"), we can simply refer to it as, <code>${sum}</code>.</p>

    <p>Thus we could show the results with the line:</p>

<pre><code class="html">
&lt;h1&gt;Your Result is: ${param.first} + ${param.second} = ${sum}&lt;/h1&gt;
</code></pre>

        <p>The complete JSP would then look as follows:</p>

<pre><code class="html">
&lt;%@ page language="java" contentType="text/html; charset=UTF-8" pageEncoding="UTF-8"%&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"&gt;

&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8"&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Results Page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Your result is: ${param.first} + ${param.second} = ${sum}&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

        <h3>Running the Example</h3>
        <p>The final view of the project files is then:</p>

    <p><img src="./img/simple-tutorial-1.jpg" style="border: 1px solid black;" alt="./img/simple-tutorial-1.jpg" title="./img/simple-tutorial-1.jpg" /></p>

        <p>To run and verify this example, select the "submitNumbers.jsp" page, and click the green play button in Eclipse. Select the Tomcat server instance, and start the application. This brings up the simple form in the IDE browser. Entering numbers into the form, and clicking submit will send a GET request to the servlet, which processes it and forwards execution to the result.jsp page to render the response. As follows:</p>

    <p><img src="./img/simple-tutorial-2.jpg" style="border: 1px solid black;" alt="./img/simple-tutorial-2.jpg" title="./img/simple-tutorial-2.jpg" /></p>

        <p>Upon submission, the results page looks as follows:</p>

    <p><img src="./img/simple-tutorial-3.jpg" style="border: 1px solid black;" alt="./img/simple-tutorial-3.jpg" title="./img/simple-tutorial-3.jpg" /></p>
