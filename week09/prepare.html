        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>This week you will learn about Express.js, a Node.js Framework that will simplify our efforts.</p>

        <h3>Preparation Material</h3>
        <p>Visit the <a href="http://expressjs.com" target="_blank">official Express.js site</a></p>
        <p>Work through each section in the "Getting Stated" module:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Installing</p></li>
            <li><p>Hello World</p></li>
            <li><p>(Optional) Express Generator - We won't use this one as directly as the others right away. If you do walk through it, you will want to use <code>--view=ejs</code> rather than using pug, because we'll be using EJS for our view engine this semester.</p></li>
            <li><p>Basic Routing</p></li>
            <li><p>Static Files</p></li>
            <li><p>FAQ</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p>When you are learning a new technology, to "work through" examples on a site like this means that you both read the material, and try out the commands they provide. Create a temporary directory that you can delete later, play around with stuff. Look at the files that are there, try changing something here or there to see what happens, etc.</p>
